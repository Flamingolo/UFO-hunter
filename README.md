# Hunt Ufo's

Duck Hunt style game, where you can click on the ufos to shoot them down.
You have 5 seconds and 3 shots per ship. After that, the ships will land.

First hit gives you 1000, second 500 and third 250 points.

When you pause the game the 5 second countdown keeps going, don't try to cheat :D
